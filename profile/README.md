## Business Context
Total Revenue: Keep track of your store's total revenue, which is the total value of bicycle sales, accessories, and services. This will give you an overview of the financial performance of the business.

### Profit Margin 
Calculate the profit margin for each product sold. The profit margin is the difference between the selling price and the cost of the product, expressed as a percentage. This will help you understand how much money you're actually making on each sale.

### Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)
COGS represents the direct costs associated with producing or acquiring the products you sell. This includes the cost of bicycles, spare parts, and accessories. Keeping this cost under control is crucial for maximizing your profit margin.

### Operating Expenses
Track all operational expenses, such as rent, salaries, electricity, marketing, etc. This will allow you to know how much you're spending to keep the business running.

### Net Profit
After deducting all expenses, you'll have the net profit, which is the actual amount of money the business is earning. A healthy net profit is essential for sustainable growth.

### Break-Even Point
Calculate the break-even point, which is the sales level required to cover all your costs and expenses, resulting in zero profit. This will help you understand the minimum sales level needed for the business to be viable.

### Inventory Turnover
Monitor how quickly your products are being sold and replaced. Efficient inventory turnover indicates that you're not holding excess stock, which can impact cash flow.

### Cash Flow
Keep an eye on cash flow, which is the movement of money in and out of your business. This is crucial to ensure you have enough funds to pay suppliers, expenses, and invest in growth.

### Return on Investment (ROI)
When making investments in marketing, expansion, or other aspects of the business, track the financial return generated by these investments. This will help make informed decisions about where to allocate resources.
